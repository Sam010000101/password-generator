# password-generator
This is my random password generator

## Description 

The challenge was to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they’ve selected by modifying starter code. 

This app will run in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML & CSS powered by JavaScript code that I've writen. It has a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

I have learned and applied the following aspects as part of this challenge;

<ul> 
    <li><strong>Javascript objects</strong> - variable arrays with properties that can be traversed.</li> 
    <li><strong>Constants</strong> - use of variables to declare constants globally that can be recalled throughout code.</li>
    <li><strong>Prompts</strong> - code that produces a browser object that requires user input.</li>
    <li><strong>Alerts</strong> - code that produces a browser object that alerts the user of a defined message.</li>
<li><strong>The While Loop</strong> - a JS statement that loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.</li>
<li><strong>1. Math.Random & 2. Math.floor</strong> - JS statements that 1. returns a random number 2. rounds down and returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given numbe </li>
</ul>
